I am  currently pursing BTech in Computer Science & Engineering at IIT (BHU), Varanasi. I have just begun my journey into the software engineering field, so I am pretty much I am a Newbie. But that's Ok.

I am currently working on a personal project -  a voice command  scientic calculator in python. Also, I like to make contributions in the open source world, and I am currently trying to contribute  majorly to  Sympy  ( Python Library for symbolic mathematics)

I have an interest in psychology, and spend my time trying to explore the field more in my free time. I am a lot concerned about the negative impact of technology ( consumer based digital buisnness directed at chidren), and what the research says is pretty scary.  I hope we can build a safer world for our children.

*Peace out.*
